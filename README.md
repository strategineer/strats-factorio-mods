# Strat's Factorio Mods

## Strats Voicepacks Mod

This mod gives your normally silent player character a voice, allowing them to verbally react to your actions and whatever is happening to them (being eaten alive by bugs for example).

This mod *should* work in singleplayer and multiplayer although I've done most of my testing so far in singleplayer (I'm hoping to rectify that very soon).

I've created a few voicepacks that you can use and I've made it as easy as possible for you to create your own voicepacks if you'd like to get creative and, possibly, surprise your friends with some funny voices.

### Limitations
Factorio (at least as of version 1.1.76) doesn't allow a mod to play a sound and have that sound "follow" a position. So if you're playing a long running voice line, and you're moving around, eventually it won't sound as though your character was saying the line anymore (you'll be hearing the sound from where the character **was** not where they **are**). I can't do anything about that other than ask the Factorio devs to work on this feature that will probably only be useful for this mod :)...
